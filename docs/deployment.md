# Deployment Guide: ACB Large Print Web Application

> **Version 2** -- April 2026. Production deployment on a RackNerd Ubuntu VPS with Docker Compose and Caddy.

This guide walks you through deploying the ACB Large Print web application on a single VPS. When you finish, you will have:

- `csedesigns.com` and `www.csedesigns.com` serving a static website (or placeholder)
- `lp.csedesigns.com` serving the Flask/Gunicorn application behind a reverse proxy
- Caddy handling TLS certificates automatically for all hostnames
- Automated daily backups of the feedback database
- A hardened server with firewall, fail2ban, and automatic security updates

The entire stack runs on one RackNerd VPS using Docker Compose.

---

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites Checklist

Confirm you have all of the following before starting:

- [ ] A RackNerd VPS running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with root SSH access
- [ ] The RackNerd welcome email containing: server IP, root password, and SolusVM credentials
- [ ] A registered domain (`csedesigns.com`) with access to its DNS settings
- [ ] A terminal or SSH client on your local machine
- [ ] An SSH key pair on your local machine (only if choosing SSH key login -- see Phase 2 for alternatives)
- [ ] 30--60 minutes of uninterrupted time

### Local Workstation Requirements

You need an SSH client and an SFTP client on your local machine.

**SSH clients by operating system:**

| OS | Built-in | Alternatives |
|----|----------|--------------|
| Windows 10/11 | `ssh` in PowerShell or Command Prompt (OpenSSH client) | PuTTY, Windows Terminal, Git Bash |
| macOS | `ssh` in Terminal | iTerm2 |
| Linux | `ssh` in any terminal | -- |

**SFTP clients:**

| Client | Platform | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Built-in `sftp` | macOS, Linux, Windows 10/11 | Terminal command, uses your SSH config |
| WinSCP | Windows | Free GUI. Import your SSH key in Connection, SSH, Authentication. |
| FileZilla | Windows, macOS, Linux | Free GUI. Use protocol SFTP (not FTP). Add key in Edit, Settings, SFTP. |
| Cyberduck | Windows, macOS | Free GUI. Supports OpenSSH keys directly. |

**If you do not have an SSH key pair yet**, create one:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
```

This works on Windows PowerShell, macOS Terminal, and Linux. Accept the default file location. Set a passphrase if desired.

### DNS Requirement

DNS A records for your domain must point to the VPS IP address **before** Caddy can issue TLS certificates. Configure DNS early (Phase 1) because propagation can take minutes to hours.

---

## RackNerd-Specific Notes

Your RackNerd welcome email contains everything you need to get started. The key details are:

- **Server IP address** -- used for SSH connections and DNS A records
- **Root password** -- used for initial SSH login only (you will disable root login after setup)
- **SolusVM / NerdVM credentials** -- for the server control panel at `https://nerdvm.racknerd.com/`

**SolusVM / NerdVM control panel** is your emergency access path. Use it to:

- **Restart** the VPS if it becomes unresponsive
- **Access the HTML5 VNC console** if SSH is locked out (this is your lifeline)
- **Reinstall the OS** if the server is unrecoverable (destroys all data)
- View bandwidth usage and server status

> **Recovery note:** If you lose SSH access at any point in this guide, log into `https://nerdvm.racknerd.com/` with your SolusVM credentials. Select your VPS, then click the **VNC** or **HTML5 Console** button. This gives you a terminal session directly on the server, bypassing SSH entirely. From there you can fix SSH configuration, firewall rules, or user accounts.

**Optional: IPv6.** Some RackNerd locations support IPv6. If you need it, submit a support ticket. Availability varies by plan and location -- verify in the RackNerd portal or by support ticket.

**Optional: SSH port change.** Some operators change the SSH port from 22 to a non-standard port as a minor hardening step. This guide uses port 22 throughout. If you change it, adjust all SSH/SFTP commands and UFW rules accordingly.

---

## Phase 1: DNS Configuration

Before touching the server, configure DNS so records have time to propagate.

### 1.1 Create A records

Log into your domain registrar's DNS management panel and create three A records, all pointing to your VPS IP address:

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A | `@` (or blank) | `YOUR_SERVER_IP` | 300 (5 min) or Auto |
| A | `www` | `YOUR_SERVER_IP` | 300 or Auto |
| A | `lp` | `YOUR_SERVER_IP` | 300 or Auto |

Replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP` with the IP address from your RackNerd welcome email.

- The `@` record handles `csedesigns.com`
- The `www` record handles `www.csedesigns.com`
- The `lp` record handles `lp.csedesigns.com`

### 1.1b Additional DNS records (recommended)

Beyond the three A records, add these records for TLS security and email anti-spoofing. These are included in the BIND zone file at `csedesigns.com.zone` in the repository root.

| Type | Name | Value | Purpose |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| CAA | `@` | `0 issue "letsencrypt.org"` | Only Let's Encrypt may issue TLS certificates |
| CAA | `@` | `0 issuewild ";"` | Block wildcard certificate issuance |
| TXT | `@` | `v=spf1 -all` | No mail servers authorized (prevents spoofing) |
| TXT | `_dmarc` | `v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=reject; adkim=s; aspf=s` | Reject unauthenticated mail |

**Why CAA?** Without a CAA record, any certificate authority can issue certificates for your domain. The CAA record restricts issuance to Let's Encrypt only, which is what Caddy uses. Subdomains like `lp.csedesigns.com` inherit the CAA policy -- Let's Encrypt walks up the domain tree and finds the permission at `csedesigns.com`. The `issuewild ";"` entry blocks wildcard certificates (`*.csedesigns.com`), which are not needed in this deployment.

**Why SPF and DMARC with no mail server?** If you do not send email from this domain, attackers can still forge the `From:` address in spam. An SPF `-all` record tells receiving mail servers that no server is authorized to send mail for `csedesigns.com`, and the DMARC `reject` policy instructs receivers to discard any mail that claims to be from your domain.

> **If you later add a mail server**, update the SPF record to include it (e.g., `v=spf1 mx -all`) and adjust the DMARC policy accordingly.

### 1.1c Zone file alternative

The repository includes a BIND zone file at `csedesigns.com.zone` with all the records above pre-configured for IP address `107.175.91.158`. You can use it in two ways:

**Option A: Import** -- If your DNS provider supports BIND zone file import, upload `csedesigns.com.zone` directly. WordPress.com DNS may or may not support BIND import -- if it fails, use Option B.

**Option B: Manual reference** -- Open `csedesigns.com.zone` and add each record manually through your registrar's DNS panel using the values in the file.

After adding records by either method, continue with Step 1.2 to verify propagation.

### 1.2 Verify DNS propagation

After creating the records, wait a few minutes and verify from your local machine:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
dig +short csedesigns.com
dig +short www.csedesigns.com
dig +short lp.csedesigns.com

# On Windows PowerShell:
Resolve-DnsName csedesigns.com
Resolve-DnsName www.csedesigns.com
Resolve-DnsName lp.csedesigns.com
```

All three should return your VPS IP address. If they do not, wait and check again. DNS propagation typically takes 5--30 minutes but can take longer depending on TTL and registrar.

You can also check from multiple locations using `https://dnschecker.org`.

> **Do not proceed to Phase 5 (Build and Launch) until DNS is verified.** Caddy will fail to issue TLS certificates if DNS does not resolve to your server.

---

## Phase 2: Server Bootstrap (One-Time)

This phase hardens the server and prepares it for Docker. Run these steps once when setting up a new VPS.

> **Automation available:** The `scripts/bootstrap-server.sh` script (see Appendix A) automates most of this phase. You can run it after connecting as root, or follow the manual steps below.

### 2.1 Connect as root

Using the IP address and root password from your RackNerd welcome email:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

Accept the host key fingerprint when prompted. Enter the root password.

### 2.2 Update the system and install base packages

```bash
apt update

DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get \
  -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confdef" \
  -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confold" \
  -y full-upgrade

apt-get -y autoremove --purge
apt-get -y autoclean
```

`full-upgrade` promotes held-back packages (unlike `upgrade`). The `Dpkg` options keep existing config files when a package ships a new default, preventing interactive prompts. `autoremove --purge` cleans up orphaned packages and their config files.

Install packages that this guide's commands require:

```bash
apt install -y \
  git \
  curl \
  ca-certificates \
  unzip \
  dnsutils \
  python3 \
  software-properties-common \
  gnupg \
  lsb-release
```

These provide: `git` (code checkout), `curl` (HTTP testing), `dig` (DNS verification), `python3` (secret generation), and dependencies for Docker installation.

Reboot to pick up any kernel updates, then reconnect:

```bash
reboot
```

Wait 30--60 seconds, then:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

> **Fix "unable to resolve host" warnings:** If you changed the server's hostname (e.g., via `hostnamectl set-hostname bishoplink`) and every `sudo` command prints `sudo: unable to resolve host yourname: Name or service not known`, the new hostname is not in `/etc/hosts`. Fix it:
>
> ```bash
> echo "127.0.1.1 $(hostname)" >> /etc/hosts
> ```
>
> Verify the warning is gone:
>
> ```bash
> sudo whoami
> ```
>
> This should print `root` with no warning. If you have not changed the hostname, you can skip this.

### 2.3 Create a non-root deploy user

```bash
adduser deploy
```

This prompts for a password and optional user details. Set a strong password and press Enter through the optional fields.

Then add the user to the sudo group:

```bash
usermod -aG sudo deploy
```

### Choose Your Authentication Method

Steps 2.4 through 2.6 set up **SSH key authentication** and then disable password login. This is the most secure path. However, if you prefer to keep using password login, follow the **Password-Only Alternative** instead.

| Path | Steps | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| **SSH key login** (recommended) | Follow 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 as written | Key-based login only, no passwords accepted |
| **Password login** | Skip to 2.4b, 2.5b, 2.6b below | Password login for `deploy`, root SSH disabled |

> **Security note:** SSH keys are stronger than passwords because they cannot be brute-forced remotely. If you choose password login, use a strong password and rely on fail2ban (Step 2.8) to limit brute-force attempts.

---

#### Path A: SSH Key Login (Steps 2.4 -- 2.6)

Follow Steps 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 below. After completing Step 2.6, skip ahead to Step 2.7.

### 2.4 Copy your SSH key to the deploy user

**From your local machine** (not the server), copy your public key:

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
ssh-copy-id deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

On Windows PowerShell (`ssh-copy-id` is not available by default):

```powershell
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

If your key is `id_rsa.pub` instead of `id_ed25519.pub`, adjust the filename.

**Alternative: paste the key manually on the server.** If the above commands fail, stay connected as root on the server and run:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/deploy/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/deploy/.ssh
nano /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Paste your public key (the contents of `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` from your local machine) into the file, save, then:

```bash
chmod 600 /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
chown -R deploy:deploy /home/deploy/.ssh
```

### 2.5 Verify key-based login in a second terminal

> **WARNING: Do not skip this step.** The next step disables password login. If your key is not working, you will be locked out of the server.

**Open a new, separate terminal window** on your local machine and verify:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

This must connect **without asking for a password**. If it asks for a password, your key was not copied correctly. Go back to Step 2.4 and fix it before proceeding.

Once connected, verify sudo works:

```bash
sudo whoami
```

Expected output: `root`

**Keep this second terminal open** as a safety net while you harden SSH in the next step.

### 2.6 Harden SSH configuration

> **WARNING: These commands disable password authentication and root login over SSH. If your SSH key is not working (Step 2.5), you will be locked out. Use the SolusVM VNC console at `https://nerdvm.racknerd.com/` to recover if this happens.**

Back in your original root terminal:

```bash
sed -i 's/^#*PasswordAuthentication.*/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sed -i 's/^#*PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
systemctl restart sshd
```

**Immediately test** by opening yet another terminal on your local machine:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

If this works with key authentication (no password prompt), SSH hardening is complete. If it fails, use the SolusVM HTML5 VNC console to edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and restore `PasswordAuthentication yes` temporarily.

After completing Step 2.6, skip ahead to Step 2.7.

---

#### Path B: Password-Only Login (Steps 2.4b -- 2.6b)

Use this path if you do **not** want to set up SSH keys. You will log in as the `deploy` user with a password.

> **If you chose Path A (SSH key login), skip this entire section and continue at Step 2.7.**

### 2.4b Verify password login as deploy

**From Windows PowerShell** on your local machine (not the server):

```powershell
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

Enter the password you created for `deploy` in Step 2.3 when prompted.

Once connected, verify sudo works:

```bash
sudo whoami
```

Expected output: `root`

If this works, the `deploy` user is correctly set up. Type `exit` to return to your local machine.

### 2.5b Harden SSH for password login

> **WARNING: Keep your current root terminal open as a safety net while making these changes. If something goes wrong, use the SolusVM VNC console at `https://nerdvm.racknerd.com/` to recover.**

In your **root** terminal on the server, disable root SSH login but keep password authentication enabled:

```bash
sed -i 's/^#*PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sed -i 's/^#*PasswordAuthentication.*/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
systemctl restart ssh || systemctl restart sshd
```

### 2.6b Verify hardened SSH

**Open a new terminal** on your local machine and test:

```powershell
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

This should connect after you enter the `deploy` password.

Now confirm root login is blocked:

```powershell
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

This should be rejected with `Permission denied`. If root login still works, re-check `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and restart sshd.

> **Important:** Never share your `deploy` password in chat, email, or any insecure channel. Type it only when your SSH client prompts for it.

After completing Step 2.6b, continue with Step 2.7.

---

### 2.7 Configure the firewall

From your deploy user session (or the root session):

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw --force enable
sudo ufw status verbose
```

Expected output should show rules for OpenSSH, 80/tcp, and 443/tcp with status `active`.

> **If you changed the SSH port**, replace `sudo ufw allow OpenSSH` with `sudo ufw allow YOUR_PORT/tcp`.

### 2.8 Install and configure fail2ban

Fail2ban monitors logs and temporarily blocks IP addresses with repeated failed login attempts.

```bash
sudo apt install -y fail2ban
```

Create a local configuration:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/fail2ban/jail.local > /dev/null << 'EOF'
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 5
bantime = 3600
findtime = 600
EOF
```

Start and enable:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

Expected output: the jail is active with 0 currently banned IPs.

### 2.9 Enable automatic security updates

```bash
sudo apt install -y unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades
```

Select **Yes** when prompted. This enables automatic installation of security patches.

### 2.10 Create a swap file

A swap file prevents out-of-memory kills when Docker builds or document processing temporarily spike memory usage. Recommended for VPS plans with 4 GB RAM or less. Still useful on 8 GB plans as a safety net.

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

Verify:

```bash
free -h
```

Expected: the Swap line shows `2.0Gi` total.

### 2.11 Create the directory structure

```bash
sudo -u deploy mkdir -p /home/deploy/app
sudo -u deploy mkdir -p /home/deploy/backups
```

Or if already logged in as deploy:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/app
mkdir -p ~/backups
```

### Phase 2 Validation

At this point you should have:

- [ ] Login as `deploy` via SSH key (Path A) or password (Path B)
- [ ] Root SSH login disabled
- [ ] Password authentication disabled (Path A) or enabled (Path B)
- [ ] UFW active with ports 22, 80, 443 open
- [ ] fail2ban protecting SSH
- [ ] Automatic security updates enabled
- [ ] Swap file active

---

## Phase 3: Install Docker (One-Time)

### 3.1 Install Docker Engine and Compose plugin

Log in as the deploy user:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

Install Docker using the official repository:

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key and repository
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

### 3.2 Allow the deploy user to run Docker

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker deploy
```

**You must log out and back in** for the group change to take effect:

```bash
exit
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

### 3.3 Verify Docker works

```bash
docker run --rm hello-world
docker compose version
```

Both commands should succeed. The `hello-world` output confirms the Docker engine is running. The `compose version` output confirms the Compose plugin is installed.

Enable Docker to start on boot (usually already enabled, but confirm):

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Phase 3 Validation

- [ ] `docker run --rm hello-world` succeeds without sudo
- [ ] `docker compose version` prints a version number

---

## Phase 4: Upload and Configure the Application

### 4.1 Upload files to the server

The application code must be present on the server before building. Choose one method.

#### Option A: Git clone (recommended if the repository is accessible)

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/accesswatch/acb-large-print-toolkit.git app
cd app
```

If the repository is private, configure SSH keys for GitHub or use a personal access token.

#### Option B: SFTP upload

Use this method if you prefer not to use git on the server, or if you are deploying from a local copy.

The Docker build requires these directories from the repository:

```
app/
  web/
    Dockerfile
    docker-compose.prod.yml
    pyproject.toml
    requirements.txt
    src/
  desktop/
    pyproject.toml
    src/
  scripts/
    bootstrap-server.sh
    deploy-app.sh
    backup-feedback.sh
    restore-feedback.sh
```

**From your local machine** (terminal SFTP example):

```bash
# Connect
sftp deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP

# Create directories if they do not already exist
sftp> mkdir app
sftp> mkdir app/web
sftp> mkdir app/desktop
sftp> mkdir app/scripts

# Upload the web directory
sftp> put -r web/ app/web/

# Upload the desktop directory (needed for Docker build)
sftp> put -r desktop/ app/desktop/

# Upload scripts
sftp> put -r scripts/ app/scripts/

sftp> exit
```

**With WinSCP or another GUI client:** Connect using SFTP protocol, navigate to `/home/deploy/`, and drag the `web/`, `desktop/`, and `scripts/` folders into the `app/` directory.

After uploading, set scripts as executable via SSH:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP "chmod 700 ~/app/scripts/*.sh"
```

Verify the upload:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP "ls -la ~/app/web/ && ls -la ~/app/desktop/"
```

You should see `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, and `src/` in the web directory, and `pyproject.toml` and `src/` in the desktop directory.

### 4.2 Create the production environment file (.env)

The `.env` file contains secrets and configuration that the Flask application reads at runtime. Docker Compose injects these into the container via the `env_file:` directive in the production compose file.

```bash
cd ~/app/web
nano .env
```

Paste the following, replacing the placeholder values:

```
SECRET_KEY=PASTE_GENERATED_KEY_HERE
FEEDBACK_PASSWORD=CHOOSE_A_STRONG_PASSWORD
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

Generate a secure `SECRET_KEY`:

```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Copy the output and paste it as the `SECRET_KEY` value in the `.env` file.

Save and restrict permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/app/web/.env
```

> **How .env works with Docker Compose:** Docker Compose has two `.env` mechanisms. First, it automatically reads a `.env` file next to the compose file for variable interpolation (`${VAR}` syntax inside the compose file itself). Second, the `env_file:` directive passes all variables from the specified file into the container as actual environment variables. This guide uses the second mechanism. The `env_file: .env` line in `docker-compose.prod.yml` injects `SECRET_KEY`, `FEEDBACK_PASSWORD`, and `LOG_LEVEL` directly into the running container, where the Flask app reads them via `os.environ.get()`.

> **Important:** The `.env` file contains secrets. Do not commit it to version control. If you cloned the repository, verify that `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`.

### 4.3 Create the Caddyfile

The Caddyfile configures Caddy to serve both the main website and the Flask application.

If the repository includes `web/Caddyfile.example`, copy and edit it:

```bash
cp ~/app/web/Caddyfile.example ~/app/web/Caddyfile
nano ~/app/web/Caddyfile
```

Otherwise, create it from scratch:

```bash
nano ~/app/web/Caddyfile
```

Paste the following content. If your domains differ from `csedesigns.com` and `lp.csedesigns.com`, replace them:

```
# Main website -- static files
csedesigns.com, www.csedesigns.com {
    root * /srv/www
    file_server
    encode gzip

    header {
        X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
        X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
        Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin
    }
}

# ACB Large Print web application -- reverse proxy to Flask/Gunicorn
lp.csedesigns.com {
    reverse_proxy web:8000
    encode gzip

    header {
        X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
        X-Frame-Options DENY
        Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin
        Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()"
        Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'none'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; font-src 'self'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self'"
        Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains"
    }
}
```

**Key details:**

- Caddy obtains separate TLS certificates for each hostname automatically.
- The main site block serves static files from `/srv/www` inside the Caddy container, which maps to `~/app/web/www/` on the host (via the Docker volume mount).
- The app site block reverse-proxies to the `web` container on the Docker network. `web:8000` is the Docker service name and internal port -- not a public address.
- If the main site is not yet built, the placeholder from Step 4.4 is served. You can replace it later without restarting Caddy.

> **Note on HSTS preload:** The HSTS header above does not include `preload`. Adding `preload` and submitting to the HSTS preload list is a serious, hard-to-reverse commitment. Only add it after you are confident HTTPS will always be available for all subdomains.

### 4.4 Create a placeholder for the main website

Caddy serves `csedesigns.com` from a `www/` directory. Create it with a placeholder page:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/app/web/www

cat > ~/app/web/www/index.html << 'EOF'
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>CSE Designs</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            font-size: 1.125rem;
            line-height: 1.5;
            max-width: 40rem;
            margin: 2rem auto;
            padding: 0 1rem;
            color: #1a1a1a;
        }
        h1 { font-size: 1.5rem; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>CSE Designs</h1>
    <p>Site coming soon.</p>
</body>
</html>
EOF
```

Replace this file with your real site content at any time. Caddy serves files from this directory without needing a restart.

### 4.5 Understand the Docker Compose configuration

The repository includes `web/docker-compose.prod.yml`, which defines the production stack. Here is the complete file for reference:

```yaml
# Production Docker Compose -- Caddy reverse proxy + Flask/Gunicorn
# File: web/docker-compose.prod.yml
#
# Usage:
#   cd ~/app/web
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build

services:
  web:
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: web/Dockerfile
    expose:
      - "8000"
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      - FLASK_DEBUG=0
    volumes:
      - feedback-data:/app/instance
    restart: unless-stopped
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "python", "-c", "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8000/health')"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s

  caddy:
    image: caddy:2-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "443:443/udp"
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile:ro
      - ./www:/srv/www:ro
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config
    depends_on:
      web:
        condition: service_healthy

volumes:
  feedback-data:
  caddy_data:
  caddy_config:
```

**Key points about this configuration:**

- **`expose: ["8000"]`** makes port 8000 available to other containers on the Docker network, but **not** to the public internet. Only Caddy can reach the Flask app. This is intentional -- do not change it to `ports:` in production.
- **`env_file: .env`** injects all variables from `.env` into the container as environment variables. The `environment:` block adds `FLASK_DEBUG=0` as a non-secret default.
- **`depends_on: web: condition: service_healthy`** prevents Caddy from starting until the Flask health check passes.
- **`feedback-data`** is a Docker named volume that persists the SQLite database across container restarts and rebuilds. Do not delete this volume unless you intend to lose all feedback data.
- **`caddy_data`** stores TLS certificates. Do not delete this volume or you may hit Let's Encrypt rate limits when re-issuing certificates.
- **`context: ..`** means the Docker build context is the parent of `web/` (the repository root). This is why `desktop/` must also be present on the server at `~/app/desktop/`.
- The `healthcheck` command runs **inside** the web container, so `http://localhost:8000/health` refers to the Gunicorn process in that container. This works correctly regardless of whether the port is published to the host.

---

## Phase 5: Build and Launch

### 5.1 Build and start containers

```bash
cd ~/app/web
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

This builds the Flask/Gunicorn image and pulls the Caddy image. The first build takes 1--3 minutes depending on VPS speed and network.

### 5.2 Validate the deployment

**Check container status:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

Expected: both `web` and `caddy` show status `Up` (web may show `Up (healthy)` after the health check passes).

**Check the web container health directly:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python -c \
  "import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8000/health').read().decode())"
```

Expected output: `ok`

> **Why not `curl http://localhost:8000/health` from the host?** Because the web container uses `expose:` instead of `ports:`, port 8000 is not published to the host network. Use the `docker compose exec` command above, or test through Caddy as shown below.

**Check through Caddy** (requires DNS to be propagated):

```bash
curl -s https://lp.csedesigns.com/health
```

Expected output: `ok`

**Check the main site:**

```bash
curl -s https://csedesigns.com/ | head -5
```

Expected: the first few lines of your placeholder `index.html`.

**View container logs if anything looks wrong:**

```bash
# Flask/Gunicorn logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs web --tail 30

# Caddy logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs caddy --tail 30

# All logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs --tail 30
```

### 5.3 Test from a browser

Open these URLs in a browser:

1. `https://csedesigns.com/` -- should show your main site (or placeholder)
2. `https://www.csedesigns.com/` -- should show the same content
3. `https://lp.csedesigns.com/` -- should show the ACB Large Print Tool landing page
4. `https://lp.csedesigns.com/health` -- should show `ok`
5. `http://lp.csedesigns.com/` -- should redirect to HTTPS automatically

### Phase 5 Validation

- [ ] Both containers running (`docker compose ps` shows `Up`)
- [ ] Health endpoint returns `ok` through Caddy
- [ ] Main site loads over HTTPS
- [ ] Flask app loads over HTTPS
- [ ] HTTP redirects to HTTPS

---

## Phase 6: TLS Certificates

Caddy handles TLS automatically. No manual certificate management is required.

### 6.1 How Caddy handles TLS

When Caddy starts with real domain names in the Caddyfile:

1. It requests free TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt via the ACME protocol
2. It configures TLS 1.2+ with strong cipher suites
3. It redirects all HTTP (port 80) traffic to HTTPS (port 443)
4. It renews certificates automatically 30 days before expiry
5. It enables HTTP/2, HTTP/3 (QUIC), and OCSP stapling

Caddy obtains separate certificates for each hostname: `csedesigns.com`, `www.csedesigns.com`, and `lp.csedesigns.com`.

### 6.2 Verify TLS is working

After starting the containers, wait 30--60 seconds for certificate issuance, then:

```bash
# Check certificate details
curl -vI https://lp.csedesigns.com 2>&1 | grep -E 'subject:|expire|issuer:'

# Verify HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect
curl -sI http://lp.csedesigns.com | head -5
```

Expected: the issuer line contains "Let's Encrypt" and the HTTP request returns a `301` redirect to `https://`.

To check your TLS grade externally, test at `https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=lp.csedesigns.com`.

### 6.3 Using Let's Encrypt staging (for testing)

If you want to test certificate issuance without hitting Let's Encrypt production rate limits (5 certificates per registered domain per week), add this global block at the **top** of your Caddyfile:

```
{
    acme_ca https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
}
```

Staging certificates are not trusted by browsers (you will see a security warning), but they confirm the ACME flow works. **Remove this block and restart Caddy** to switch back to production certificates:

```bash
cd ~/app/web
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart caddy
```

### 6.4 Custom certificates (optional)

If you need to use a certificate from a different CA (not Let's Encrypt), update the relevant site block in your Caddyfile:

```
lp.csedesigns.com {
    tls /etc/caddy/certs/cert.pem /etc/caddy/certs/key.pem
    reverse_proxy web:8000
    encode gzip
    # ... rest of headers
}
```

Place your certificate files in `~/app/web/certs/` and add a volume mount to the `caddy` service in the compose file:

```yaml
  caddy:
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile:ro
      - ./certs:/etc/caddy/certs:ro
      - ./www:/srv/www:ro
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config
```

---

## Phase 7: Auto-Restart on Reboot

Docker's `restart: unless-stopped` policy in the compose file handles automatic container restarts. Confirm Docker itself starts on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Test by rebooting:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reconnecting (wait 30--60 seconds):

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
docker compose -f ~/app/web/docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

Both containers should show `Up`. If they do not:

```bash
cd ~/app/web
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs --tail 30
```

---

## Phase 8: Monitoring

### 8.1 UptimeRobot (recommended)

UptimeRobot provides free external uptime monitoring with email and SMS alerts.

1. Sign up at [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com)
2. Add a new monitor:
   - **Type:** HTTP(s)
   - **URL:** `https://lp.csedesigns.com/health`
   - **Interval:** 5 minutes
3. Optionally add a second monitor for `https://csedesigns.com/`
4. Configure alert contacts (email, SMS, or webhook)

### 8.2 Disk usage monitoring

Add a simple disk check to the deploy user's crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line to log a warning if root filesystem usage exceeds 80%:

```
0 6 * * * df -h / | awk 'NR==2 && int($5)>80' >> /home/deploy/disk-alerts.log 2>&1
```

Check the log periodically:

```bash
cat ~/disk-alerts.log
```

> **Want email alerts?** Install a lightweight SMTP relay like `msmtp`:
>
> ```bash
> sudo apt install -y msmtp msmtp-mta
> ```
>
> Then configure `/etc/msmtprc` with your outbound mail provider's SMTP settings (Gmail App Password, SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.). This requires an external SMTP account and is optional. A full mail server setup is outside the scope of this guide.

---

## SFTP Operations Reference

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) runs over your existing SSH connection. No additional software, passwords, or open ports are needed.

> **Never use FTP or FTPS.** Plain FTP transmits credentials in cleartext. SFTP is encrypted and uses your existing SSH key.

### Connecting via SFTP

```bash
sftp deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

This uses the same SSH credentials from Phase 2 (key or password). Once connected, you see the `sftp>` prompt.

### Common operations

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Upload a single file | `sftp> put local-file.txt /home/deploy/app/web/` |
| Upload a folder recursively | `sftp> put -r ./web /home/deploy/app/web` |
| Download a single file | `sftp> get /home/deploy/backups/feedback-20260411.db ./` |
| Download a folder | `sftp> get -r /home/deploy/backups ./local-backups` |
| List remote directory | `sftp> ls -la /home/deploy/app/web/` |
| Change remote directory | `sftp> cd /home/deploy/app/web` |
| Show current remote directory | `sftp> pwd` |
| Create remote directory | `sftp> mkdir /home/deploy/app/web/www` |
| Delete a remote file | `sftp> rm /home/deploy/app/web/old-file.txt` |
| Exit | `sftp> exit` |

### Uploading updated app files

When deploying a code update without git:

```bash
sftp deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
sftp> put -r ./web/src /home/deploy/app/web/src
sftp> put ./web/pyproject.toml /home/deploy/app/web/
sftp> put ./web/requirements.txt /home/deploy/app/web/
sftp> exit
```

Then rebuild via SSH:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP "cd ~/app/web && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build"
```

### Uploading and running scripts

```bash
sftp deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
sftp> put -r ./scripts /home/deploy/app/scripts
sftp> exit
```

Then set permissions via SSH:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP "chmod 700 ~/app/scripts/*.sh"
```

> **Why use SSH for permissions?** Some SFTP clients support setting file permissions during upload, but behavior varies by client and platform. Using SSH commands after upload is consistent and verifiable. Always confirm permissions with `ls -l` or `stat` after upload.

### Downloading a backup

```bash
sftp deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
sftp> cd /home/deploy/backups
sftp> ls -la
sftp> get feedback-20260411-020000.db ./local-backups/
sftp> exit
```

### Replacing a configuration file

```bash
sftp deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
sftp> put ./Caddyfile /home/deploy/app/web/Caddyfile
sftp> exit
```

Then restart Caddy to pick up the change:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP "cd ~/app/web && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart caddy"
```

### Checking ownership and permissions

After uploading files, verify they are owned by the deploy user and have correct permissions:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP

# List files with ownership and permissions
ls -la ~/app/web/

# Detailed info for a specific file
stat ~/app/web/.env

# Fix ownership if needed (e.g., after uploading as a different user)
sudo chown -R deploy:deploy ~/app/

# Secrets should be readable only by the owner
chmod 600 ~/app/web/.env
```

### GUI client connection settings

For WinSCP, FileZilla, Cyberduck, or any SFTP-capable client:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Protocol | SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) |
| Host | YOUR_SERVER_IP |
| Port | 22 |
| Username | deploy |
| Authentication | SSH private key (Path A) or password (Path B) |

### Directory reference

| Remote path | Contents |
|-------------|----------|
| `/home/deploy/app/` | Repository root (git clone or SFTP upload root) |
| `/home/deploy/app/web/` | Flask app, Dockerfile, compose files, Caddyfile, .env |
| `/home/deploy/app/web/src/` | Flask application source code |
| `/home/deploy/app/web/www/` | Static files for csedesigns.com |
| `/home/deploy/app/desktop/` | Python core library (needed for Docker build) |
| `/home/deploy/app/scripts/` | Deployment helper scripts |
| `/home/deploy/backups/` | Feedback database backups |

### Restricting SFTP to a specific directory (optional)

If you want to allow SFTP access only to the app directory (not the full filesystem), create a restricted user with a chroot jail. Add to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```bash
Match User sftponly
    ChrootDirectory /home/deploy/app
    ForceCommand internal-sftp
    AllowTcpForwarding no
    X11Forwarding no
```

Then create the restricted user:

```bash
sudo adduser sftponly --shell /usr/sbin/nologin
sudo usermod -aG docker sftponly
sudo chown root:root /home/deploy/app
sudo chmod 755 /home/deploy/app
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

This is optional -- the default `deploy` user with full SSH access is sufficient for most deployments.

---

## Routine Operations

All commands below assume you are logged in as the `deploy` user via SSH. For commands involving the compose file, either `cd ~/app/web` first or use the `-f` flag:

```bash
# Short form (after cd):
cd ~/app/web
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps

# Long form (from anywhere):
docker compose -f ~/app/web/docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

### Deploying updates

**With Git:**

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
cd ~/app
git pull origin main
cd web
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

**With SFTP:** Upload changed files (see SFTP Operations Reference), then:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
cd ~/app/web
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

**Using the deploy script:**

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
~/app/scripts/deploy-app.sh
```

The build takes 30--90 seconds. There is a brief downtime (a few seconds) during container restart.

After deploying, verify:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
curl -s https://lp.csedesigns.com/health
```

### Viewing logs

```bash
cd ~/app/web

# Flask/Gunicorn logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs web --tail 50 -f

# Caddy logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs caddy --tail 50 -f

# All logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs --tail 50 -f
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop following logs.

### Restarting services

```bash
cd ~/app/web

# Restart just the Flask app (Caddy stays up)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart web

# Restart just Caddy (e.g., after a Caddyfile change)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart caddy

# Restart everything
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart
```

### Stopping everything

```bash
cd ~/app/web
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
```

This stops and removes containers but **preserves volumes** (feedback data and TLS certificates).

> **Do not use `docker compose down -v`** unless you intend to delete all volumes, including the feedback database and TLS certificates.

### Checking disk usage

```bash
# Overall filesystem
df -h /

# Docker-specific (images, containers, volumes)
docker system df

# Detailed Docker disk usage
docker system df -v
```

### Backing up feedback data

Feedback is stored in a SQLite database inside the `feedback-data` Docker volume.

**Manual backup:**

```bash
cd ~/app/web
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml cp web:/app/instance/feedback.db ~/backups/feedback-$TIMESTAMP.db
echo "Backup saved: ~/backups/feedback-$TIMESTAMP.db"
```

**Automated daily backups (recommended):**

Use the `backup-feedback.sh` script. Schedule it with cron:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line to run daily at 2 AM:

```
0 2 * * * /home/deploy/app/scripts/backup-feedback.sh >> /home/deploy/backups/backup.log 2>&1
```

The script creates timestamped backups and removes backups older than 30 days. See Appendix A for the full script.

**Download backups to your local machine:**

```bash
sftp deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
sftp> cd /home/deploy/backups
sftp> ls -la
sftp> get feedback-20260411-020000.db ./local-backups/
sftp> exit
```

### Restoring feedback data

> **WARNING: Restoring replaces the current feedback database. The web container will be stopped briefly during the restore.**

**Manual restore:**

```bash
cd ~/app/web

# Stop the web container
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop web

# Copy the backup into the volume
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml cp ~/backups/feedback-20260411-020000.db web:/app/instance/feedback.db

# Start the web container
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml start web

# Verify
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python -c \
  "import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8000/health').read().decode())"
```

Expected: `ok`

**Using the restore script:**

```bash
~/app/scripts/restore-feedback.sh ~/backups/feedback-20260411-020000.db
```

The script validates the backup file, stops the container, copies the backup, starts the container, and verifies health. See Appendix A for the full script.

### Reviewing feedback

Set `FEEDBACK_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file (see Phase 4.2), then rebuild and visit:

```
https://lp.csedesigns.com/feedback/review?key=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

### Cleaning up old Docker images

```bash
docker image prune -a --filter "until=720h"
```

This removes images older than 30 days that are not in use by a running container.

### Renewing TLS certificates

Caddy renews certificates automatically 30 days before expiry. No manual action needed. To check certificate expiry:

```bash
curl -vI https://lp.csedesigns.com 2>&1 | grep "expire date"
```

### Updating the server OS

Automatic security updates are enabled (Phase 2.9). Run this monthly for non-security updates:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Reboot if the kernel was updated:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reconnecting, verify containers restarted:

```bash
docker compose -f ~/app/web/docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

### Updating Docker Engine

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### DNS not propagated

**Symptom:** `curl https://lp.csedesigns.com` fails with "Could not resolve host" or Caddy logs show certificate issuance failure.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
dig +short lp.csedesigns.com
dig +short csedesigns.com
```

If the output does not match your VPS IP, DNS has not propagated.

**Fix:** Wait. Propagation typically takes 5--30 minutes but can take up to 48 hours with high TTL values. Verify at your registrar that the A records are correct. Check from multiple locations at `https://dnschecker.org`.

### Caddy certificate issuance failed

**Symptom:** Browser shows "Your connection is not private" or Caddy logs show ACME errors.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
cd ~/app/web
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs caddy --tail 50
```

**Common causes and fixes:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| DNS not pointing to this server | Verify: `dig +short YOUR_DOMAIN` must return your VPS IP |
| Ports 80/443 blocked by firewall | `sudo ufw status` -- must show 80 and 443 ALLOW |
| Rate limited by Let's Encrypt | Wait 1 hour. Use staging CA for testing (Phase 6.3). |
| Caddy not running | `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps` and restart if needed |
| Another process using port 80/443 | `sudo ss -tlnp \| grep -E ':80\|:443'` -- only Caddy should be listening |

After fixing the cause, restart Caddy:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart caddy
```

### Container exits immediately

**Symptom:** `docker compose ps` shows the web container as `Exited`.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs web --tail 50
```

**Common causes:**

- **Missing `.env` file:** If `env_file: .env` is specified but the file does not exist, the container will not start. Create it per Phase 4.2.
- **Python import error:** A dependency is missing or broken. The traceback will identify the module.
- **Syntax error in app code:** The traceback will show the file and line.

**Quick test (bypasses .env requirement temporarily):**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm --no-deps web python -c \
  "from acb_large_print_web.app import create_app; print('OK')"
```

### Firewall mistakes

**Symptom:** Cannot connect on port 80, 443, or 22 from outside, but the server is running.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

**Fix:** If ports are missing:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
```

**If you accidentally blocked SSH:**

Log into `https://nerdvm.racknerd.com/`, select your VPS, and click the **VNC** or **HTML5 Console** button. From the console:

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw reload
```

### Disk full

**Symptom:** Builds fail, containers crash, or logs show "No space left on device."

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
df -h /
docker system df
```

**Fix:**

```bash
# Remove unused Docker resources (images, stopped containers, networks)
docker system prune -a

# Clean apt cache
sudo apt clean

# Find large files
sudo du -sh /var/log/* | sort -rh | head -10

# Truncate a large log file if needed
sudo truncate -s 0 /var/log/syslog
```

### Health endpoint failing

**Symptom:** `curl https://lp.csedesigns.com/health` returns an error or times out.

**Step-by-step diagnosis:**

```bash
cd ~/app/web

# 1. Is the web container running?
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps web

# 2. Can the health check pass inside the container?
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python -c \
  "import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8000/health').read().decode())"

# 3. Is Caddy running and healthy?
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps caddy

# 4. What does Caddy say?
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs caddy --tail 20

# 5. Is the firewall allowing traffic?
sudo ufw status
```

If step 2 fails, the Flask app has a problem (check web logs). If step 2 succeeds but external access fails, check Caddy logs and firewall rules.

### SSH access lost

**Cannot connect via SSH at all:**

1. Log into `https://nerdvm.racknerd.com/`
2. Select your VPS
3. Click the **VNC** or **HTML5 Console** button
4. Log in as `deploy` (or `root` if root login was not yet disabled)
5. Check and fix:
   - `sudo ufw status` -- is SSH allowed?
   - `sudo systemctl status sshd` -- is SSH running?
   - `cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep -E 'PasswordAuth|PermitRoot'` -- are settings correct?
   - `sudo systemctl restart sshd` -- restart SSH after any changes
6. Try connecting via SSH again from your local machine

**Server completely unresponsive (VNC console also hangs):**

1. In SolusVM / NerdVM, click **Reboot**
2. Wait 2 minutes, then try SSH
3. If still unresponsive, click **Shutdown**, wait 30 seconds, then **Boot**
4. **Last resort:** Use the **Reinstall** option in SolusVM to reinstall the OS. This destroys all data. Download backups via SFTP first if possible.

### Upload fails with 413 error

The file exceeds the 500 MB upload limit configured in the Flask app (`MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`). This is by design. Upload a smaller file.

### "sudo: unable to resolve host" warnings

**Symptom:** Every `sudo` command prints `sudo: unable to resolve host yourname: Name or service not known`. Commands still work, but the warning is noisy.

**Cause:** The server's hostname was changed (e.g., via `hostnamectl set-hostname`) but the new name was not added to `/etc/hosts`.

**Fix:**

```bash
echo "127.0.1.1 $(hostname)" >> /etc/hosts
```

Verify:

```bash
sudo whoami
```

Should print `root` with no warning.

### Permission denied in container

The container runs as user `app` (non-root). Only `/app/instance/` and `/tmp/` are writable inside the container. The Dockerfile creates and `chown`s the instance directory. If you see permission errors, check that the Docker image was built correctly:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm web ls -la /app/instance/
```

The owner should be `app`.

### Connection refused on ports 80/443

```bash
# Check firewall
sudo ufw status verbose

# Check what is listening
sudo ss -tlnp | grep -E ':80|:443'

# Check container status
cd ~/app/web
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

If `ss` shows nothing listening on 80/443, Caddy is not running. Check its logs and restart.

## Smoke Test Checklist

Run through this checklist after initial deployment or after a major change. Every item should pass.

## Environment Variables Reference

These variables are set in `~/app/web/.env` and injected into the container via the `env_file:` directive:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | **Yes** | Random per-start | Flask session and CSRF secret. **Set a fixed value in production** or sessions and CSRF tokens will not survive container restarts. |
| `FEEDBACK_PASSWORD` | No | (unset) | Set to enable feedback review at `/feedback/review?key=<password>`. When unset, the review endpoint is disabled. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `INFO` | Python logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR. |

These are set directly in the compose file `environment:` block (not secrets):

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | `0` | Disables Flask debug mode. Never set to `1` in production. |

The Flask app also reads `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` (default: 500 MB) for upload file size limits, configured in the application source code.

## Appendix A: Shell Scripts

These scripts are located in `scripts/` in the repository. Upload them to `~/app/scripts/` on the server and make them executable:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/app/scripts/*.sh
```

### bootstrap-server.sh

Run this **as root** on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VPS to install base packages, Docker, and configure security. Does **not** modify SSH settings -- that remains a manual step to avoid lockouts.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bootstrap-server.sh -- One-time server setup for Ubuntu 24.04 VPS
#
# Run as root:  bash bootstrap-server.sh
#
# This script:
#   - Updates the system
#   - Installs base packages (git, curl, dnsutils, python3, etc.)
#   - Installs Docker Engine and Compose plugin
#   - Installs fail2ban and configures it for SSH
#   - Installs unattended-upgrades for automatic security patches
#   - Configures UFW firewall (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
#   - Creates a swap file (if none exists)
#   - Creates the deploy user (if not exists)
#
# This script does NOT:
#   - Modify SSH configuration (too risky to automate -- do it manually)
#   - Copy SSH keys (must be done from your local machine)
#   - Create .env or Caddyfile (environment-specific)
#
# After running this script, follow the manual steps in deployment.md:
#   Path A (SSH key login):
#     1. Copy your SSH key to the deploy user
#     2. Verify key-based login in a second terminal
#     3. Harden SSH (disable password auth and root login)
#   Path B (password login only):
#     1. Verify password login as deploy
#     2. Harden SSH (disable root login, keep password auth)

## Appendix B: Reference Files

### Production Docker Compose (docker-compose.prod.yml)

This file ships with the repository at `web/docker-compose.prod.yml`. See Phase 4.5 for a full listing and explanation.

### Caddyfile template (Caddyfile.example)

This file ships with the repository at `web/Caddyfile.example`. Copy it to `Caddyfile` and replace the domain names. See Phase 4.3.

### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile ships with the repository at `web/Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim AS base

ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

WORKDIR /app

COPY desktop/pyproject.toml desktop/
COPY desktop/src/ desktop/src/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir ./desktop

COPY web/pyproject.toml web/requirements.txt web/
COPY web/src/ web/src/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir ./web

RUN addgroup --system app && adduser --system --ingroup app app
RUN mkdir -p /app/instance && chown app:app /app/instance

USER app
EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["gunicorn", \
     "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", \
     "--workers", "2", \
     "--timeout", "120", \
     "--access-logfile", "-", \
     "acb_large_print_web.app:create_app()"]
```

**Image pinning (optional):** For fully reproducible builds, pin the base image digest:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim@sha256:<digest> AS base
```

Run `docker pull python:3.13-slim` and note the digest. Update periodically for security patches.

### Development Docker Compose (docker-compose.yml)

The development compose file at `web/docker-compose.yml` publishes port 8000 directly to the host without Caddy. Use it for local development only:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: web/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - FLASK_DEBUG=0
    volumes:
      - feedback-data:/app/instance
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "python", "-c", "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8000/health')"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s

volumes:
  feedback-data:
```

For production deployment, always use `docker-compose.prod.yml`.
