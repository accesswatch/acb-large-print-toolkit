# Deployment Strategy: ACB Large Print Web Application

## Overview

This document describes the safe, failsafe deployment process for the GLOW Accessibility Toolkit web application. The strategy prioritizes **zero data loss**, **automatic rollback on failure**, and **transparent user communication** during maintenance.

Before production deployment, the preferred workstation gate is a WSL-hosted Docker staging run plus focused regressions. That catches container/runtime differences earlier while keeping the production server deploy script narrow and predictable.

### Recommended Pre-Production WSL Gate

From Windows PowerShell on the development workstation:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\scripts\wsl-stage-regression.ps1
```

This staging lane:

1. Starts the web stack in the target Ubuntu WSL distro using `web/docker-compose.yml` plus `web/docker-compose.wsl.yml`
2. Waits for `/health` on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
3. Runs the focused pytest regression suite for current web changes
4. Runs the Playwright browser regression suite against the running WSL-hosted Docker stack
5. Defaults AI feature flags to off so the staged behavior matches the intended non-AI production rollout

Prerequisite:

- Docker Desktop WSL integration must be enabled for the Ubuntu distro you target. If `docker` is missing inside WSL, fix that first; the staging script intentionally stops there rather than silently falling back to Windows Docker.

## WSL: Local replication and port notes

For developers who want to reproduce the exact WSL environment used for pre-production staging (including a system Apache + WordPress install side-by-side with Docker), we maintain a companion repository `wsl-BishopLink` under `D:\code\wsl-BishopLink`.

- Run the bootstrap to replicate the workstation environment (install packages, shell tooling, Playwright dependencies, etc):

```bash
# inside WSL
bash /mnt/d/code/wsl-BishopLink/bootstrap-wsl.sh
```

- The replication repo includes an interactive helper `install_apache_wordpress.sh` that installs `apache2`, `mariadb`, PHP, and drops a WordPress copy into `/var/www/html` for local development. Run it with `sudo` and follow prompts:

```bash
sudo /mnt/d/code/wsl-BishopLink/install_apache_wordpress.sh
```

- Important port note: on developer machines the system Apache in WSL frequently binds host ports `80`/`443`. To avoid collisions the GLOW compose files and this replication guidance bind Caddy to host ports `8080` (HTTP) and `8443` (HTTPS) by default. Use `http://localhost:8080` and `https://localhost:8443` to access the local site when running the Docker stack.

- If you want Docker/Caddy to use `80`/`443` instead, stop and disable the system Apache inside WSL (requires `sudo`):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl disable apache2
# then restart Docker/Caddy with the original compose ports
```

- The bootstrap avoids forcing an `npm` user prefix if `nvm` is detected, to prevent startup warnings and prefix/globalconfig conflicts with `nvm`.

- WP-CLI: The bootstrap installs WP-CLI (`wp`) for local WordPress management. Run `wp --info` to verify. When operating on files under `/var/www/html/wordpress` run commands as the `www-data` user to keep file ownership correct (for example: `sudo -u www-data wp plugin update --all`).

- Exporting WordPress for replication: to create portable artifacts that can be committed or archived into the replication repo, run the following from inside WSL (adjust filenames as desired):

```bash
# archive the WordPress files (preserves ownership when restored using sudo)
sudo tar -czf /mnt/d/code/wsl-BishopLink/wordpress-files-$(date +%F).tar.gz -C /var/www/html wordpress

# dump the WordPress database (you will be prompted for the MariaDB root password)
sudo mysqldump -u root -p --databases wordpress > /mnt/d/code/wsl-BishopLink/wordpress-db-$(date +%F).sql

# If you prefer a single, permission-preserving snapshot you can run as root and copy the artifacts into D: from WSL
```

## Deployment Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation

1. **Backup the feedback database** (automatic via `ENABLE_PREDEPLOY_BACKUP=1`)
   - Prevents loss of user feedback if something goes wrong
   - Backup is stored in `~/app/backups/feedback/` with ISO8601 timestamp

2. **Enable Maintenance Mode** (`MAINTENANCE_MODE=1`)
   - All HTTP requests (except `/health`) receive a `503 Service Unavailable` response
   - Users see a clean, accessible "Under Maintenance" page
   - The `<title>` announces the reason and expected timeframe
   - `/health` endpoint remains available for deployment orchestration

3. **Pull latest code from Git** (if `.git` directory exists)
   - Ensures the Docker build reflects the latest commits
   - Baseline commit is captured for rollback

### Phase 2: Build & Start

4. **Build and start Docker containers**
   - `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build`
   - Web app and Pipeline (DAISY) services start
   - Containers restart automatically on failure (`restart: unless-stopped`)

5. **Wait for health check** (up to 40 attempts × 3 seconds = ~2 minutes)
   - The deployment script polls `/health` until the app responds `200 OK`
   - If healthy within timeframe: proceed to Phase 3
   - If not: proceed to Phase 4 (Rollback)

### Phase 3: Success - Deployment Goes Live

6. **Disable Maintenance Mode** (`MAINTENANCE_MODE=0`)
   - Restart containers with the flag disabled (one more `docker compose up -d --build`)
   - Users now see the live application
   - All features are available

7. **Confirm deployment**
   - Health check still passes on the new code
   - URLs are shown for manual testing (main domain, app domain, etc.)
   - Container status is displayed

---

## Rollback Process (Automatic on Failure)

If the health check fails:

### Phase 4: Automatic Rollback

1. **Disable Maintenance Mode** immediately
   - Restart containers with `MAINTENANCE_MODE=0`
   - Ensures users see the **previous good version**, not a maintenance page

2. **Checkout previous Git commit** (if Git is available)
   - `git checkout -f <PRE_DEPLOY_COMMIT>`
   - Reverts all code to the last known-good state

3. **Rebuild and restart with previous code**
   - `docker compose up -d --build`
   - Containers re-pull from the previous commit

4. **Verify rollback health check**
   - Poll `/health` again (up to 40 attempts)
   - If rollback passes: deployment ends with rollback message
   - If rollback fails: **manual intervention required** (exit code 1, error message shown)

## Usage

### Automated Deployment

```bash
# On the production server as the deploy user:
bash ~/app/scripts/deploy-app.sh

# Or with custom configuration:
APP_DOMAIN=glow.example.com \
  bash ~/app/scripts/deploy-app.sh
```

### Manual Maintenance Mode Control

For operational tasks (without deploying code):

```bash
# Enable maintenance mode (e.g., for database migration, manual updates)
bash ~/app/scripts/maintenance-mode.sh on

# Disable maintenance mode (bring site back online)
bash ~/app/scripts/maintenance-mode.sh off

# Check current status
bash ~/app/scripts/maintenance-mode.sh status
```

---

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Recovery |
|------|---------|----------|
| 0 | Successful deployment | None needed; site is live |
| 1 | Pre-flight check failed | Fix missing files/setup and retry |
| 1 | Health check failed + rollback failed | **Manual intervention:** SSH to server, check Docker logs, potential restore from backup |

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `MAINTENANCE_MODE` | 0 (off) | Set to `1` to show maintenance page; `/health` always responds |
| `APP_ROOT` | `$HOME/app` | Directory containing the entire repository |
| `WEB_ROOT` | `$APP_ROOT/web` | Directory containing docker-compose.prod.yml and Dockerfile |
| `COMPOSE_FILE` | `docker-compose.prod.yml` | Docker Compose configuration file |
| `APP_DOMAIN` | `lp.csedesigns.com` | Primary domain (used in test URLs) |
| `APP_ALIAS_DOMAIN` | (empty) | Secondary domain alias (if configured) |
| `MAIN_DOMAIN` | `csedesigns.com` | Main site domain (used in test URLs) |
| `ENABLE_PREDEPLOY_BACKUP` | 1 | Create feedback DB backup before deploy (recommended: keep at 1) |

---

## Failsafe Features

### 1. **Multi-Level Health Checking**
- Both new deployment and rollback verify `/health` endpoint
- Failures are detected early (40 attempts over ~2 minutes)
- No silent failures

### 2. **Automatic Rollback**
- If new code fails health check, previous Git commit is checked out and rebuilt
- Existing users never see a broken site (either live app or maintenance page)
- Feedback database is protected with pre-deploy backup

### 3. **Maintenance Mode Transparency**
- Users see a clear, accessible "Under Maintenance" page
- No mysterious 5xx errors or timeout messages
- Expected timeframe is 15–30 minutes

### 4. **Manual Intervention Escalation**
- If rollback also fails, deployment exits with code 1 and descriptive error
- Admin is notified immediately and must investigate
- Server VPS emergency console (SolusVM) is always available as last-resort recovery

### 5. **Deployment Idempotency**
- Re-running `deploy-app.sh` is safe (same result each time)
- No state corruption from partial deployments
- Safe to re-trigger if network interruption occurs

---

## Monitoring & Testing

### During Deployment

```bash
# From any terminal, monitor the running deployment:
cd ~/app/web
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs --tail 50 -f web

# In another terminal, check container health:
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

### Post-Deployment Testing

```bash
# Test main URLs (replace domain as needed):
curl -I https://lp.csedesigns.com/
curl -I https://lp.csedesigns.com/health
curl -I https://csedesigns.com/

# Check for maintenance mode (should see 503 if enabled):
curl -I https://lp.csedesigns.com/audit

# Verify health endpoint always works (200 OK):
curl -I https://lp.csedesigns.com/health
```

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Hangs (Health Check Not Passing)

**Symptom:** Script shows `.` (dot) characters continuing for 2+ minutes.

**Resolution:**
1. Stop the script (Ctrl+C)
2. Check logs: `docker compose logs web --tail 50`
3. Common causes:
   - Database connection failed
   - Missing environment variable (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`)
   - Port 8000 already in use by another process
4. Fix the issue and re-run `deploy-app.sh` (automatic rollback will recover)

### Rollback Also Failed

**Symptom:** Script exits with "Rollback health check: FAILED" and exit code 1.

**Resolution:**
1. **This is rare but serious.** Manual intervention required.
2. SSH to the server as the deploy user
3. Check which commit was deployed: `git log --oneline -1`
4. Inspect container logs: `docker compose logs web --tail 100`
5. Manually restore from the pre-deploy backup (see `~/app/backups/feedback/`)
6. Once stable, commit the fix and re-deploy

### Maintenance Page Stuck Visible

**Symptom:** Deployment succeeded but users still see "Under Maintenance".

**Resolution:**
1. Manually disable maintenance mode: `bash ~/app/scripts/maintenance-mode.sh off`
2. Or wait for the next deployment (it will disable maintenance mode on success)

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always deploy during off-peak hours** (e.g., 10 PM – 6 AM)
2. **Keep pre-deploy backups enabled** (`ENABLE_PREDEPLOY_BACKUP=1`)
3. **Run deployment from a stable network** (avoid mobile hotspots)
4. **Have a terminal open with logs during deployment** (`docker compose logs -f`)
5. **Test key flows post-deployment:**
   - Upload a document to audit
   - Download an audit report
   - Check admin queue (if you have access)
6. **Announce scheduled maintenance** to users (via email, status page, etc.)
